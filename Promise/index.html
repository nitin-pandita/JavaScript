      Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operation in javascript. It is
      an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either
      a resolved value or a reason that it's not resolved (e.g., a network error
      occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled,
      rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the
      fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.
